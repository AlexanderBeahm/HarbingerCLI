Incorporate my own way of doing things into ChatGPT and the OpenAI platform in general. Making a personal CLI seems like an amazing experience among other things, a great thing to put on Github and resume. Sick stuff inbound.

For some reason it felt like a fun idea to use this Obisdian vault as both a form of self-documentation / devblog all in one. Excited to get going on this! The future is AI.
