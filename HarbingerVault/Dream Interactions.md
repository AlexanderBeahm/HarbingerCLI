This project has a lot of "dream interactions" I'd hope to fulfill for personal use cases.

---

# Contextual Menu
## I'd like to give some form of language training to text input (of any sort) and have it display a list of contextual options. These rulesets will be defined in the knowledge vault.

## I'd like markdown vault folders to be determined at execution-time and/or runtime. This would allow for multiple vaults to be consumed, or to be removed, at runtime.

# In Process Character Development
## I'd like for certain files to be ingested (the vault) that will define system behavior and personality. This will allow for pure flexibilty of Harbinger being able to open a vault (w/ some standardizations) and be able to attune itself.
